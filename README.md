Big O Notation and Sorting Algorithms README

Introduction
This README file provides an overview of Big O notation and common sorting algorithms. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument approaches infinity. It is commonly used in computer science to analyze algorithms and their efficiency in terms of time and space complexity. Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and are used to arrange elements of a list or array in a specific order.

Big O Notation
Big O notation, often represented as O(), describes the upper bound of the growth rate of a function. It provides a way to classify algorithms based on their worst-case performance. Common notations include:

O(1): Constant time complexity. The algorithm's performance does not change with the size of the input.
O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
O(n): Linear time complexity. The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the input size.
O(n log n): Linearithmic time complexity. Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.
O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. Performance grows quadratically with the input size, common in inefficient sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort.
O(2^n): Exponential time complexity. The performance doubles with each additional element in the input.
O(n!): Factorial time complexity. The performance grows factorially with the input size, common in brute-force algorithms
